				<h3>Donald Trump - The 45th president of the United States</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="circle trump"></span>
					Trump was born and raised in Queens, New York. He attended Fordham University and received a
					bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania. While a student and after
					graduating in 1968, Trump worked at his father's real estate company. Trump's political party
					affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987, switched
					to the Reform Party in 1999, the Democratic Party in 2001, and back to the Republican Party in 2009.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková. They have three children, Donald Jr. (born
					1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984). The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's
					affair with actress Marla Maples. Maples and Trump married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. In 2005,
					Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss.
				</p>
				<p>
					Donald Trump has been a presidential candidate three times, in 2000, 2016, and 2020 respectively.
					His second presidential campaign in 2016 was successful. He was elected 45th president of the United
					States on November 8, 2016 and inaugurated on January 20, 2017. He is seeking reelection in the 2020
					United States presidential election.
				</p>
				<p>
					Trump's re-election campaign saw declining poll numbers by mid-2020, reflecting dissatisfaction with
					his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread racial justice protests following the killing
					of George Floyd. Several sources described his campaign message as shifting to "racist rhetoric" in
					an attempt to reclaim voters lost from his base.

				<h3>Joe Biden - The 47th Vice President of the United States</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="circle biden"></span>
					A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States Senator for Delaware from 1973 to
					2009. Biden is the Democratic presidential nominee for the 2020 election. He studied at the
					University of Delaware and graduated from Syracuse University College of Law, with a law degree in
					1968. He later said he found law school "the biggest bore in the world". He became a lawyer in 1969
					and was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970. He was elected to the U.S. Senate from
					Delaware in 1972.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1966 Biden married Neilia Hunter. They had three children, Joseph R. in 1969, Robert Hunter in
					1970, and Naomi Christina in 1971. On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after the election, Biden's
					wife Neilia and their one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident in
					Hockessin, Delaware. Biden considered resigning to care for them, but the Senate Majority Leader
					persuaded him not to.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was reelected six times to the U.S. Senate and was the fourth-most senior senator when he
					resigned after winning the vice presidency alongside Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.
					In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction. Biden
					announced his 2020 candidacy for president in 2019.
				</p>
				<p>
					On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the
					Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.
